\section{Geometry of reconstructed surfaces}\label{sec:rbfs}

From the previous section, we have analytic expressions for the energy and power densities, and consequently the
Lagrangian force density, $\F$ (see~\ref{sec:forces}).  The RBC and platelet force models require first and second
derivatives along their surfaces.  Additionally, the IB force spreading operation requires quadrature weights for
the cell surfaces. This section finishes where we left off by discussing the construction of the necessary
discrete linear operators and quadrature weights $\weight[j]$ through the use of RBF-based methods.
