\section{Solution of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations}\label{sec:ins}

\input{disc-figure}

To discretize the Navier-Stokes equations~\eqref{eq:ins-momentum}--\eqref{eq:ins-incomp},
we use a marker-and-cell (MAC) grid~\cite{Welch:1965jv}: for grid cell center $\x_i$,
scalar-valued function $s(\x)$ is discretized at $\x_i$, and component $\e_a\cdot\vec{v}$
of vector-valued function $\vec{v}(\x)$ at $\x_i - \sfrac12h\e_a$, where $\e_a$ is a
canonical basis vector. Define the centered difference operator
\begin{equation*}
    D_a\phi(\x) = \frac{\phi(\x+\sfrac12 h\e_a) - \phi(\x-\sfrac12 h\e_a)}{h},
\end{equation*}
for which, e.g., $D_1$ approximates differentiation in the $x$ direction. The discrete
divergence, gradient, and Laplacian operators use centered differences, resulting in a
2-point stencil for each discrete first derivative and the standard 7-point discrete
Laplacian. We also define the centered average operator
\begin{equation*}
    A_a\phi(\x) = \frac{\phi(\x+\sfrac12 h\e_a) + \phi(\x-\sfrac12 h\e_a)}2.
\end{equation*}
By averaging $u$ in the $y$ direction and $v$ in the $x$ direction, we obtain collocated
approximations to $u$ and $v$ at the center of a cell edge. Averaging, e.g., $u$ in the
$x$ direction yields an approximation to $u$ at the cell center. We can therefore
discretize the components of the advection term $\div(\u\otimes\u)$ by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:advection}
    \div[h](\u\otimes\u) := %D_b[H^{bl}_rH^{am}_s (A_l u^s(\x,\,t)) (A_m u^r(\x,\,t))].
    \left[\begin{array}{c}
        D_1[(A_1 u) (A_1 u)] + D_2[(A_1 v) (A_2 u)] + D_3[(A_1 w) (A_3 u)] \\
        D_1[(A_2 u) (A_1 v)] + D_2[(A_2 v) (A_2 v)] + D_3[(A_2 w) (A_3 v)] \\
        D_1[(A_3 u) (A_1 w)] + D_2[(A_3 v) (A_2 w)] + D_3[(A_3 w) (A_3 w)]
    \end{array}\right].
\end{equation}
The symbol $\div[h]$ represents the discrete divergence operator.  Figure~%
\ref{fig:discretization} illustrates the steps in computing $D_2[(A_1 v)(A_2 u)]$, which
appears in the first component in Equation~\eqref{eq:advection}. Morinishi \latin{et al}.
show that this scheme, $Div. - S2$ in their parlance,\comment{Use dash not comma.}{They call it ``$Div.-S2$'', so I think --- here would be confusing} is conservative under the assumption
that $\u$ is discretely divergence-free~\cite{Morinishi:1998us}.

To advance the solution, we use an implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta (RK) method. We use
either the 1-stage backward-forward Euler scheme~\cite{Ascher:1997tm} or the 2nd-order
2-stage scheme described by Peskin~\cite{Peskin:2002go}, which require only one spreading
operation~\eqref{eq:ib-spread} per time step. For the backward-forward Euler scheme,
discretizing Equation~\eqref{eq:ins-momentum} to advance time to $t+\timestep$, yields
linear solves of Helmholtz type,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:disc-momentum}
    (I - \timestep\rho^{-1}\mu \laplacian_h) \u^\ast = \u^n - \timestep\left[\div[h]\left(\u^n\otimes\u^n\right) + \rho^{-1}\left(\f^{n+1} - \grad[h]p^n\right)\right] \quad\text{in}~\domain, \\
\end{equation}
with boundary conditions
\begin{equation}\label{eq:disc-bdy}
    \u^\ast = \u^{n+1}_b + \timestep \grad[h] q^{n} \quad\text{on}~\partial\domain,
\end{equation}
where superscripts denote the time step, $\u_b$ is velocity boundary data, $\laplacian_h$
and $\grad[h]$ are the discrete Laplacian and gradient, respectively, and $q$ is
described below. The force density $\f^{n+1}$ is advanced explicitly. The intermediate
velocity field $\u^\ast$ may not be divergence-free. To obtain a velocity field that
satisfies~\eqref{eq:ins-incomp}, we use projection method II (PmII) of Brown, Cortez, and
Minion~\cite{Brown:2001bq}. PmII updates the pressure
\begin{equation*}
    p^{n+1} = p^n + (\rho I - \timestep\mu\laplacian_h)q^{n+1},
\end{equation*}
and generates the divergence-free velocity field
\begin{equation}\label{eq:vel-update}
    \u^{n+1} = \u^\ast - \timestep\grad[h]q^{n+1}
\end{equation}
using pseudo-pressure $q^{n+1}$, which satisfies
\begin{equation}
\begin{alignedat}{2}
    &\alpha k \laplacian_h q^{n+1} = \div[h]\u^\ast &&\quad \text{in}~\domain, \\
    &\n\cdot\grad[h] q^{n+1} = 0                    &&\quad \text{on}~\partial\domain.
\end{alignedat}
\end{equation}
The velocity update~\eqref{eq:vel-update} provides the boundary conditions~%
\eqref{eq:disc-bdy} using a lagged value of the pseudo-pressure. The 2-stage RK method
consists of a backward-forward Euler step followed by a Crank-Nicolson-midpoint step,
which involves only minor modifications to Equation~\eqref{eq:disc-momentum}. In total,
we perform 3 Helmholtz solves and 1 Poisson solve per RK stage.

We employ preconditioned conjugate gradients (PCG) to perform the solves. We use
Chebyshev iteration as a preconditioner for the Helmholtz solves and as an error
smoothing procedure and direct solver for multigrid (MG) to precondition the Poisson
solve. Chebyshev iteration is a generalization of weighted Jacobi iteration which
requires only the ability to perform sparse matrix polynomial-vector multiplication.
Chebyshev iteration (MG) PCG is therefore parallelized by using a parallel sparse
matrix-vector multiplication routine with Horner's method to evaluate the polynomials.

In the case of a triply periodic domain, it is clear that the linear solves involve
symmetric matrices. For Dirichlet or Neumann boundaries, we extrapolate using values at
the neighboring grid points and boundary data to fill ghost points. In these situations,
the standard discrete second derivative may actually approximate some non-unit multiple
of its continuous counterpart near the boundary. To account for this but maintain
symmetry of the Helmholtz matrices, we scale equations involving near-boundary values,
excluding the offending discrete second derivative and ghost cell terms. The trade-off is
3 extra diagonal matrix-vector multiplications per RK stage for the ability to use PCG
for the linear solves. For details, see~\ref{sec:boundary-correction}.
