\subsection{Convergence study}\label{sec:convergence}

In this section, we perform a series of tests on a single perturbed RBC undergoing relaxation. We simplify the RBC
model and use only Skalak's Law. We expect the IB method to approximate the fluid velocity at first order for thin
shells, as it cannot recover the pressure jump across the interface. We stretch the RBC by a factor of 1.1 in the
$z$ direction and compress it in the $x$ direction to maintain its reference volume. We place the cell in the
center of a $16\um\times16\um\times16\um$ domain with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions in the $y$
direction and periodic boundaries elsewhere. The fluid velocity is initially zero. The cell is then allowed to
relax for $180\us$.

We use the 3-point kernel $\hat{\Dirac}_1$ derived by Roma \latin{et al.}~\cite{Roma:1999tx} for spreading and
interpolation and the 2-stage RK method described in \cref{sec:ib} to advance the fluid velocity. Fluid grids are
chosen to have $20r$ grid points per $16\um$ in each direction for $r$ from 1 to 6. On successive grids, we
compare the fluid velocity at cell centers in a regular grid of $20^3$ cells and surface positions at 1000 surface
points. For convergence of order $p$, we expect the ratio of successive errors to satisfy
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\epsilon_r}{\epsilon_{r+1}} = \left|\frac{{((r+1)/r)}^p-1}{{((r+2)/(r+1))}^{-p}-1}\right|,
\end{equation}
which we solve numerically to determine $p$. We compute the errors in $\X$ using discrete versions of the $L^2$
and $L^\infty$ norms,
\begin{gather}
    \|\X(\theta, \varphi)\|_2^2 =
    \int\limits_{\sphere} \X(\theta, \varphi)\cdot\X(\theta, \varphi) \d\qs \quad\text{and} \\
    \|\X(\theta, \varphi)\|_\infty^2 =
    \max_{(\theta, \varphi)} \X(\theta, \varphi)\cdot\X(\theta, \varphi),
\end{gather}
respectively.

\Cref{tab:u-rbc-conv,tab:x-rbc-conv} show $L^2$ and $L^\infty$ errors in $\u$ and $\X$ between successive grids.
We observe first-order convergence, as expected. Satisfied with the convergence of our implementation, we
henceforth continue using the Bauer spiral to discretize RBCs.
%We continue in the next section by verifying that the
%RBF-IB method dissipates energy.
