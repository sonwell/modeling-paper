\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

We have taken a number of departures from traditional application of the IB method and
RBC models. In the following sections, we establish convergence for our implementation
of RBF-IB, demonstrate impermeability of the RBCs, and observe typical RBC behaviors
before presenting the results of our whole blood simulations.

%PoC that the idea may work:
%\begin{itemize}
%    \item Flat vs elongated at $1000\si{\per\second}$
%    \begin{itemize}
%        \item PLTs + flat wall, no RBCs
%        \item PLTs + flat wall + rbcs --- $\times 4$, different starts
%        \item PLTs + perturbed wall(s) --- $\times 4$, different starts
%    \end{itemize}
%    \item Cobblestone wall
%\end{itemize}

%Random start algo:
%\begin{enumerate}
%    \item Pick $t^n = t^{n-1} + T\ms$, $t^0 = 16\ms$ and $T$ sampled from $\text{Poisson}(3)$. RBCs only start overtaking one another around 16--$19\ms$
%    \item At time $t^n$, $n \ge 1$,
%        \begin{enumerate}
%            \item Pick random endo + PLT points twice, endo points separated by $3.9\um = \text{PLT radius} + 4h$
%            \item compute $\n_\text{endo}$ and $\n_\text{plt}$ at those points
%            \item pick random distance $r$ between $0.3\um$ and $1\um$ twice
%            \item rotate PLTs so $\n_\text{endo} = -\n_\text{plt}$ and the end and plt points are $r$ apart. 
%            \item check that PLT does not get too close to other endo points or RBCs.
%                Favors PLTs oriented at an intermediate angle: more likely to choose points near edge, but they generate a sharp angle, which typically leads to intersection with RBCs.
%            \item otherwise, repeat up 100 times, then give up for this time step
%        \end{enumerate}
%    \item Start simulations at first 4 successful times with added PLTs
%\end{enumerate}
