\section{Results}\label{sec:results}

We have taken a number of departures from the traditional application of the IB method and RBC models. In the
following sections, we establish convergence for our implementation of RBF-IB, demonstrate its energy dissipation properties, demonstrate impermeability of the
RBCs, and observe typical RBC behaviors before presenting the results of our whole blood simulations.
